Developing a custom module in Drupal with hook_cron() involves several steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide with examples and code to help you get started.

**Step 1: Set Up a Drupal Environment**

Make sure you have a Drupal environment set up. If not, you can download and install Drupal from Drupal’s official website.

**Step 2: Create a Custom Module**

 1. Create a New Module Directory: In your Drupal installation, navigate to the modules directory and create a new directory for your module, e.g., mymodule.
 2. Create an .info.yml File: Inside mymodule, create a file named mymodule.info.yml. This file tells Drupal about your module.

name: 'My Custom Module'
type: module
description: 'A custom module with cron functionality.'
package: Custom
core: '8.x'


** 3. Create a .module File: This is where you’ll write your PHP code. Create a file named mymodule.module.**

Step 3: Implement hook_cron()

Inside the mymodule.module file, you’ll implement the hook_cron() function. This function will be executed automatically when Drupal’s cron runs.

/**
 * Implements hook_cron().
 */
function mymodule_cron() {
 // Your custom logic here.
 \Drupal::logger('mymodule')->notice('Cron run at @time', ['@time' => date('c')]);
 // Add more tasks to perform during cron.
}

**Step 4: Enable Your Module**

Before your hook_cron() can be executed, you need to enable your module.

 1. Go to the Extend section of your Drupal site.
 2. Find your module in the list and enable it.

**Step 5: Test Your hook_cron()**

To test if your cron job is running:

 1. Manually run cron from the Drupal status report page or use Drush command drush cron.
 2. Check your logs to see if the message from your cron job appears.

Additional Tips

 • Ensure your Drupal cron is set up correctly. You can configure it under the “Configuration” -> “System” -> “Cron”.
 • For more complex tasks, consider using Drupal’s Queue API with hook_cron() to process tasks in batches.
 • Remember to clear the cache after adding new hooks to ensure Drupal recognizes your changes.

Example Use Case

Suppose you want your custom module to clean up temporary files every time cron runs. You could add a function to hook_cron() to handle this.

function mymodule_cron() {
 // Logic to delete temporary files.
 mymodule_delete_temp_files();

 // Log the action.
 \Drupal::logger('mymodule')->notice('Temporary files cleanup performed.');
}

function mymodule_delete_temp_files() {
 // Add your file deletion logic here.
}

This is a basic outline to get you started with hook_cron() in a custom Drupal module. Depending on your specific needs, you might need to delve deeper into Drupal’s API and best practices.
